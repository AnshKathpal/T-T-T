# Tic-Tac-Toe App
(Still Under Development)

## Description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking the cells of a 3x3 grid with 'X' and 'O' symbols. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your marks. This readme provides an overview of a Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using the following tech stack: React, Redux, and Chakra UI.

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend on the same device, taking turns to make your moves.

- **Interactive Grid**: Click on the cells to place your 'X' or 'O' symbol.

- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins and highlights the winning line.

- **Draw Detection**: If no player wins, the game detects a draw and prompts for a new game.

- **Score Keeping**: Track and display the number of games won by each player.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **React**: The user interface of the Tic-Tac-Toe app is built using React, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.

- **Redux**: Redux is used for state management, ensuring that the application maintains the game state and allows for easy interaction between components.

- **Chakra UI**: Chakra UI provides a set of accessible and customizable components for creating a visually appealing and responsive design.
